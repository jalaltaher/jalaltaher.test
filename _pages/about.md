I am PhD student at Pars-Saclay University, affiliated with the Mathematics Department at Versailles-St-Quentin University, under the supervision of Céline Duval and Ester Mariucci. My thesis title is 'Statistics for jump processes and applications'. I have explored the following directions in the past few years: 
- **Non-parametric density estimation and adaptive estimation** for Lévy process,
- **Inverse problems**, deconvolution of the small jump density of Lévy processes.
- **Monte-Carlo methods for trajectory simulation**, simulation of $\alpha-$stable and Classical tempered stable Lévy processes.
- **Gaussian approximation of small jumps**.

Before joining the Mathematics Laboratory of Versailles (LMV), I earned an MSc in Probability and Statistics from the Paris-Saclay University. In 2019, I graduated with a major in Applied Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique. My academic journey includes a BSc in pure and applied mathematics at the University Paris-Sud, Orsay obtained in 2016, and a BA in philosophy in 2019 at Nanterre University (parallel with my scientific curriculum).

**Research Interests**: *Nonparametric statistics, Stochastic processes,SDE  Deconvolution, Lévy processes, Stable distributions, Exponential tilting...*

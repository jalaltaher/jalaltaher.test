I am PhD student at Pars-Saclay University affiliated with the Mathematics Department at Versailles-St-Quentin University under the supervision of Céline Duval and Ester Mariucci. My main focus in PhD is Statistics for jump processes and applications. In particular, I focused on direct and inverse problems in the context of Lévy processes. 

Before joining the Mathematics Laboratory of Versailles (LMV), I earned an MSc in Probability and Statistics from the Paris-Saclay University. In 2019, I graduated with a major in Applied Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique. My academic journey includes a BSc in pure and applied mathematics at the University Paris-Sud, Orsay obtained in 2016, and a BA in philosophy in 2019 at Nanterre University (in parallel with my scientific curriculum).

Research Interests: Nonparametric statistics, Stochastic processes, Deconvolution, Lévy processes, Stable distributions, Exponential tilting...

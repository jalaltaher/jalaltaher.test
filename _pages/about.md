I am a PhD student at Pars-Saclay University, affiliated with the Mathematics Department at Versailles-St-Quentin University, under the supervision of Céline Duval and Ester Mariucci. My thesis title is 'Statistics for jump processes and applications'. I have explored the following topics in the context of Lévy processes during my PhD: 
- **Non-parametric density estimation** 
- **Adaptive methods for Fourier estimators**.
- **Inverse problems**.
- **Monte-Carlo methods for trajectory simulation**.
- 
Before joining the Mathematics Laboratory of Versailles (LMV), I earned an MSc in Probability and Statistics from the Paris-Saclay University. In 2019, I graduated with a major in Applied Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique. My academic journey includes a BSc in pure and applied mathematics at the University Paris-Sud, Orsay obtained in 2016, and a BA in philosophy in 2019 at Nanterre University (parallel with my scientific curriculum).

**Research Interests**: *Nonparametric statistics, Stochastic processes, SDE,  Deconvolution, Lévy processes, Stable distributions, Exponential tilting...*
